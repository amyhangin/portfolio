        <p>The content shared on <em>Amy Hang in</em> is produced and written by Amy Hang. Her professional career started after graduating with a Bachelor's in Digital Media and Music Business. With a love of travel and music, she decided to move to South Korea and teach English abroad. During her 4.5 years living in South Korea, she experienced many life experiences dealing with a language barrier, different cultures of people, and living on her own. Being in a country with a fast-growing entertainment industry, the experience of going to music concerts and festivals was abundant and exciting. There was so much to see and learn. Food is another topic that is loved. Whenever and wherever she travels, food is a connection to culture and the destination she visits.</p>
        <p>As of mid-2022, her focus is to develop software that could help communities in need. In order to improve her skills, she is studying programming languages such as <code>HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python,</code> and many more. She is also striving to create content to share with others about travel, food, and culture.</p>
